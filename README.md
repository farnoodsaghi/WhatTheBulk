4. Open cmd (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OS and Linux) and change to the WhatTheBulk directory by running the following command (Do NOT forget to replace the {dir_location} part with where the directory is stored on YOUR system. For e.g. C:\Users\username\Downloads\WhatTheBulk): `cd {dir_location}`
5. Once inside the directory, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# How to Use
1. Type in your message in the `message.txt` file
2. Paste in your numbers in the `numbers.txt` file, putting each number on its own line. Also, note that you will need to include the country code at the beginning of each number
4. Open cmd (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OS and Linux) and change to the WhatTheBulk directory by running the following command (Do NOT forget to replace the {dir_location} part with where the directory is stored on YOUR system. For e.g. C:\Users\username\Downloads\WhatTheBulk): `cd {dir_location}`
5. Once inside the directory, run `python3 main.py` to start the program
6. Double check your message and numbers and press ENTER to continue.
7. Once the Chrome windows opens up, scan the WhatsApp Web QR code to login
8. The program should then carry on sending your message to all the numbers. For best results, make sure you do NOT minimize the Chrome window while the program is running and you don't block the window with other application windows.
9. DISCLAIMNER: I am not responsible for anyone getting banned for using this program. The use of third party bulk-texting applications is against WhatsApp's ToS and they could ban you for it. That being said, it is highly unlikely if you use this program responsibly. Limit the number of messages you send to =>150 daily and you should be fine.
